# wle-aligner

Experimental utility tool to align a Wonderland Engine project to another one.  
This means:
- Matching the IDs of the objects/resources if they represent the same thing on both projects

## :warning: Warning
This tool is very experimental.
To perform this alignment it tries to guess which objects/resources might represent the same thing on both projects. This means that there might be mistakes in this process.  
Always verify that the aligned project is OK after using the tool.  
Make sure to use version control.

**This is just a preview of the tool, for now only the [wle-uuidify](#wle-uuidify) tool is available.**
